trimming phase 2 :

if the average quality of a window of bases is less than the threshold then we remove the part of the read after it(along with the low quality window) => we are losing information.
If we do error correction before, we can improve this situation.

cutadapt : 
it matches part of the barcode and removes it. Set parameters such that it does not trim unnecessary small portions of the read. (eg: matches 3 bp for 48 bp long barcode)

chimeric reads :
                   read : =====
           ______
- - - - - - - -----------------
- - - - - - - - ---------------
           ______
           cut site
=====

the paired end reads are from different sets and they do not cover the cut site, hence we are unable to recognize that they are not "truely paired"

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
MADE ./bac_seq/scripts/from_HY/readcut/runreadcut.sh that counts the no. of paired reads having intermediate cut sites.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
No. of reads chimeric reads ( reads which have cut site inside ) are veyr high. What to do?
If we split the read, then what should be the ID of these new reads??

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
all the reads in input files are in reverse order. The barcodes are at the end and eventually the cut sites are also at the end.
