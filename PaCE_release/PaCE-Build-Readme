Instructions to build PaCE executables from source code:
--------------------------------------------------------

Run the "make" command from the shell.

(For system specific MPICH and C compilers modify the MakeFile appropriately.) 
After successful build, copy the executables into the folder:

cp PreprocessPaCE.pl PaCE-pipeline/PaCE-clustering
cp PaCE PaCE-pipeline/PaCE-clustering 

Checklist for a successful build:
-	Executables created: PaCE
-	No fatal errors or "serious" warnings flagged by the compiler (minor warnings OK)
-	The mk uses O3 optimization level.  If this high level is not
	supported by the C compiler being used, change it to a lower level
	like O2 or O1 or O0 as appropriate.
